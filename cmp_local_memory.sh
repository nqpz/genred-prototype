# We compare the different local-memory-using kernels.  For each of the three
# methods -- atomicAdd, atomicCAS, and atomicExch -- we compare the
# *_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP kernel with the *_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_COL kernel on a
# variety of datasets.
#
# Kernel explanations:
#
#   - *_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP (*3): Uses local memory, chunking, and an adjustable
#     cooperation level (number of threads cooperating over a subhistogram).
#
#   - *_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_COL (*4): The same, but associates subhistograms with
#     threads in a way that each thread in a warp accesses a unique
#     subhistogram, assuming the number of subhistograms in a block is a
#     multiple of the warp/wavefront size.  For example, if both the number of
#     subhistograms and the warp size is 32, we will get zero intra-warp
#     conflicts -- and even if the number of subhistograms is 16 or 8, we should
#     still at least see a reduction.
#
# For atomicExch we also compare with the kernels SHLOCK_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_AEXCH
# and SHLOCK_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_THREADID that use locks based on lock-step
# execution semantics, and only work under the assumption of number of
# subhistograms being aligned to the warp size.  Kernels:
#
#   - SHLOCK_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_AEXCH: Keep using atomicExch, but do it in the
#     same piece of local memory as the histogram.
#
#   - SHLOCK_SHARED_CHUNK_COOP_THREADID: Use an ad-hoc locking mechanism using
#     thread ids in the same piece of local memory as the histogram.
#
# All of these kernels has a reduction pass at the end which we do not measure
# (because we do not implement an efficient reduce in this test framework).
#
# We would like to see if the *_COL kernels are never slower than the "base"
# kernels in edge cases, and always faster in common cases.
#
# Datasets:
#
#   - Random.
#
#   - All indices are the same.  All writes go to index 0.  This is adverserial
#     to all approaches, but the question is which one handles it the least
#     worst.
#
#   - No intra-warp conflicts even with the base (row) kernels, assuming a large
#     enough number of subhistograms (aligned with the warp size).  This is
#     designed to be adverserial towards the *_COL kernels, which are not
#     expected to cause a speedup here.
#
# We run each kernel 100 times just because it really doesn't take that long.
